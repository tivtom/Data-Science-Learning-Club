# Data-Science-Learning-Club
My www.becomingadatascientist.com Forum Activities Code

You can follow along with my code for each of the week's learning activities.
Each week has a folder, with some screen shots and my Julia code.

I will also be blogging about them on www.tiveron.ca

Find out more about Julia at www.julialang.org
